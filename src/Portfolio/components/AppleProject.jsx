      <h1>Apple Online Store â€“ Onsite Contractor</h1>

        <h3>Experience Description:</h3>
        <p>I joined Apple as an Onsite Contractor in April 2022, 
            working at the Apple Online Store. At that time, the work-from-home policy was still in effect, 
            but I was informed that one day I would return to the company office. So, 
            I packed up my few pieces of furniture and moved to Austin. 
            I was very excited at that time because having the opportunity to join a large technology company was something I had always dreamed of,
            and I believed that I would definitely enhance my professional skills through this experience.</p>
        <p>Our team's main responsibility is to build applications for internal employees to upload, modify, and delete content on the Apple Online Store. 
            The overall project has already been established, 
            so much of our work involves maintaining existing programs and improving performance. Occasionally, 
            we also develop new APIs based on requirements.</p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring Boot, Java 17, and Gradle were used for daily development.</li>
            <li>Kafka was utilized as a message distribution tool.</li>
            <li>Cassandra was adopted as the database application, along with Solr Admin for database management.</li>
            <li>AWS EC2 was used for code hosting.</li>
            <li>Splunk served as the log monitoring tool.</li>
            <li>Jenkins was employed for CI/CD management.</li>
            <li>InfraRED was used for project deployment.</li>
            <li>The entire project adopted a microservices strategy, 
                which allows for project responsibility to be divided based on different content and facilitates debugging. 
                However, the downside is that when documentation is not comprehensive, 
                the setup for new employees can be a nightmare.</li>
